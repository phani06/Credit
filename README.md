# Credit
This code to check whether the your credit card "mater card" and "visa" or "INVALID" A credit (or debit) card, of course, is a plastic card with which you can pay for goods and services. Printed on that card is a number thatâ€™s also stored in a database somewhere, so that when your card is used to buy something, the creditor knows whom to bill. There are a lot of people with credit cards in this world, so those numbers are pretty long: American Express uses 15-digit numbers, MasterCard uses 16-digit numbers, and Visa uses 13- and 16-digit numbers. And those are decimal numbers (0 through 9), not binary, which means, for instance, that American Express could print as many as 10^15 = 1,000,000,000,000,000 unique cards!
